# QoreAi Platform Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the QoreAi platform to GitHub and Render for testing and feedback collection.

## 1. GitHub Deployment

### Setting up the GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "qoreai-platform")
   - Choose visibility (private recommended for initial testing)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Initialize your local repository and push to GitHub
   \`\`\`bash
   # In your project directory
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/qoreai-platform.git
   git push -u origin main
   \`\`\`

3. Invite collaborators for testing
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" > "Collaborators"
   - Add team members by username or email

## 2. Render Deployment

### Deploying to Render

1. Create a Render account
   - Go to [Render](https://render.com) and sign up or log in

2. Connect your GitHub repository
   - In Render dashboard, click "New" > "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
   - Select your QoreAi repository

3. Configure your web service
   - Name: "qoreai-platform" (or your preferred name)
   - Environment: Node
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
   - Select appropriate instance type (Free tier for testing)

4. Set environment variables
   - Add your GROQ_API_KEY and any other required environment variables
   - These can be added in the "Environment" section of your service settings

5. Deploy the service
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Render will automatically build and deploy your application

6. Access your deployed application
   - Once deployment is complete, Render will provide a URL for your application
   - Share this URL with your colleagues for testing

## 3. Collecting Feedback

1. Set up a feedback collection system
   - Create a dedicated Slack channel or use a tool like Trello or GitHub Issues
   - Provide clear instructions for testers on what to focus on

2. Key areas for feedback:
   - AI integration functionality
   - User interface and experience
   - Equipment monitoring accuracy
   - Predictive maintenance suggestions
   - Performance on different devices

3. Implementing feedback
   - Prioritize feedback based on impact and effort required
   - Create a development roadmap for implementing changes
   - Regularly update testers on progress

## 4. Continuous Integration/Deployment

For a more advanced setup, consider implementing CI/CD:

1. GitHub Actions
   - Create a `.github/workflows/main.yml` file for automated testing and deployment
   - Configure it to run tests on pull requests and deploy to Render on merges to main

2. Automated testing
   - Implement unit and integration tests
   - Set up automated UI testing with tools like Cypress

## 5. Next Steps After Testing

1. Refine the AI integration based on feedback
2. Optimize performance for production use
3. Implement additional security measures
4. Prepare marketing materials highlighting the manufacturing-specific AI capabilities
5. Plan for a phased rollout to early adopters in the manufacturing industry
